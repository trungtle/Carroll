Carroll is an Occulus Rift-compatible, exploratory, escape the room game. Player interacts with potions within the game environment to change their body sizes that would allow them to enter a different perspective to explore the room.

Carrol is the proud winner of [PennApps XIII](http://devpost.com/software/carroll) for Best Design.
